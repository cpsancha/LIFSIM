function digitizedData=digitizeGraph(imageName,numberPoints)
%This function lets users digitize a published graph that is saved as
%a image e.g. jpeg
%User needs load the image into matlab workspace before running this program.
%User needs to provide the name of the image, and the number of data
%points to be digitized. The user will be asked to indicate on the
%image the pixel position corresponds to the origin, a value on x axis and
%a value on y axis. These are used to scale the user selected data points.
%usage exampe:digitizeGraph(testGraph,3);
imagesc(imageName);
imageName=imageName(:,:,1); %reduse the RGB into just any one component for digitization
%prompt user to digitize the origin
disp('Indicate the pixel position corresponds to the origin:');
[x0 y0]=ginput(1);
display('Your chosen origin is at pixel position:');
disp([x0 y0]);
%add a negative sign for y offset calculation
disp('Note that Matlab considers the left upper most pixel is the (0,0) pixel.');
disp('To transform simply set y = -(y-y0) and x = x-x0;');
%prompt user to digitize a value on x axis

%calculate the conversion ratio of y
xratio=xvalue/(x1-x0);
